Encrytion : ./fput_encrypt.o ~/Desktop/SE_Proj4/file < input
Decryption: ./fget_decrypt.o ~/Desktop/SE_Proj4/file

Decrypted output in file.dec
fget_decrypt prints HMAC signature verification status.
If output is 0, then signature is matched.
If output is 1, then signature is unmatched.  

Assumptions:
1. No append option in fput_encrypt.
2. Program Files need to be executed from the folder that contains 
all the programs.
